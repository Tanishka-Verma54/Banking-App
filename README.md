# Banking-App
This Python code is created for basic banking operations (deposit, withdraw, check balance) and includes an EMI calculator for loans.

This code shows how a basic **banking application** might look using the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python, handling everything from basic transactions to sophisticated loan computations, while guaranteeing data integrity and ensuring a seamless user experience.

The **`BankAccount`** class is the heart of the application. When you, the user, decide to open an account, its `__init__` method sets up the class for you. It takes your name and your initial deposit, ensuring that deposit is at least zero. It even loads a small default balance (**₹500.00**) if you do not specify an amount, giving every account a safe starting point.

The core methods, **`deposit`** and **`withdraw`**, are the workhorses of the class. The deposit function is very straightforward, simply adding valid, positive amounts into your **`balance`**. The withdrawal function is a bit more sophisticated, acting as a critical **financial guardrail**. It first checks that the amount requested meets the **minimum withdrawal limit**, ₹0.01, and more crucially that the current balance can cover the transaction. This blocks the account from going into an unauthorized overdraft. After any transaction, the method **`check_balance`** keeps you informed with an updated summary.

The thing that makes this code more than a simple ledger is the **`take_loan`** method, which actually acts as an **EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) calculator**. It uses the standard formula for amortization, given the loan **principal** and the number of **years**, to calculate the fixed monthly payment. It breaks down the math using the constant **`LOAN_ANNUAL_RATE`** (12%), converts it to a monthly rate, and correctly estimates the installment you would need to pay.

A number of **helper functions** are defined to make the application truly usable. The **`get_valid_amount`** and **`get_valid_integer`** functions are important for the graceful handling of user input. They use a continuous loop, prompting the user to enter a valid, positive number - or an exit command such as 'q'-without the application crashing due to bad input. Finally, the **`main_app`** function is the interface of the whole application. It walks you through the creation of an account and then presents you with a clean, text-based menu-using choices 1 through 5-that lets you loop through different operations until you choose to exit. This structure provides a complete, interactive simulation of a real-world bank account experience.
